# Stackable-Anti-Malware-File-System

Developed an Anti-Malware File System (under Prof. Erez Zadok) on top of Wrapfs File system to intercept read,
write, lookup and other system calls and check against a known malicious pattern database. A user level IOCTL
program was written to read and update the pattern database.
